Lab 4 Part 4 README notes

This week, I thought the ThinkPython exercises were pretty easy in Part 1. I completed them pretty easily using the Jupyter notebook online. However,
when I uploaded the .py file to Github, I thought it looked wrong (you can see that version in Lab4Part1.py), so I created a new file where I just copy
and pasted the code from the notebook into Github directly without downloading the file off Jupyter. I did download them as ipynb files first and
then tried to download them as .py files by changing the extension which might be incorrect. I thought Part 2 was also pretty easy to figure out
after reading and following along with the lecture. I chose to focus my area of interest on New York City because I grew up around that area and I 
imported a layer that adds in the parks and public lands around the city. There were no areas that I really got stuck or recieved an unexpected result
in this section. I did use the notebook within ArcGIS and the map just appeared as an insert within the notebook, so I was wondering if it should
instead appear as a map scene within ArcGIS itself.
