# 8.13 Exercises
# Exercise 2
# There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in Section 8.7.
# Read the documentation of this method and write an invocation that counts the number
# of aâ€™s in 'banana'.

word = 'banana'
count = 0
index_a = word.count('a')
index_a

# I had little trouble using the count string method. I thought this exercise was easy.

# Exercise 3
# A step size of -1 goes through the word backwards, so the slice [::-1] generates a
# reversed string. Use this idiom to write a one-line version of is_palindrome
# from Exercise 3.

def is_palindrome(word):
    if word == word[::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
is_palindrome('redivider')

# It took a little while to fully understand what the slice [::-1] did, but now that I do,
# I can see how useful it is for many contexts.
